# Popcorn Time Ru API server

It's API server, you don't need this for watch films. Just download client from project page (http://popcorn-ru.tk/).
Or simply put http://popcorn-ru.tk/ as the Custom API Server in the advanced settings if you use the official Popcorn Time app (0.4.4+git).

If you want add some trackers or create self server - then fork it.

It's hosted in free tier google cloud - search is slow - no elastic and 580 mb ram.
No anime now, please extend api if you know same api for anime as tmdb for films and shows.
